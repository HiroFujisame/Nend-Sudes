## To anyone reading this: I don't even know if this'll be famous someday, like Anne Frank's diary.

---

21/apr/2021 - I started making a website with my sister for our Discord bot project, it's going pretty well for now, except none of us are good at web-designing. No, we don't want to use wix or wordpress, maybe just a little of bootstrap, can't reveal much of it just yet (sry).

---

22/apr/2021 - I started to read a book I had for years called "Gravitation Red" (I also have the Blue one) and... Idk exactly what to say about it, it's just so heart touching besides all it's "tsundere" thingys. Anyways, I'm almost in the half now and it's just so good I can't stop reading. I think I was missing this feeling from No Game No Life while it lasted, it's still my favorite story thought.

26/apr/2021 - So yesterday I got drunk while playing Overwatch with my best friend and i got MVP, lool our team was so noob we carried'em while drunk.

also i'm downloading Devil May Cry 1, 2 and 3. i never played but always heard so good about it i decided to give it a try.

---

27/apr/2021 - WOW, ok so, DMC has the best lore of all the stories from games i paid attention to, i could spend hours writing about it but i'll spare you from it.


this night my friends asked me if i was ok because i was playing dmc the whole day, i finished dmc1 yesterday around 11pm and was playing dmc2 and 3 since 2am, i finished them all and was playing with vergil when i noticed i was playing dmc3 for 14 hours straight lol, i'm starting to think i'm not ok at all.
Anyways, i'm downloading dmc4, i wont be able to play the 5 because my pc can't run it tho. :/

---

28/apr/2021 - I fucking love my friends, they started sharing DMC memes because they knew i'm into it, so lovely.
Also i'm trying to take a break from gaming so i started learning how to use the windows powershell, it's preatty neat tho, i can do lots of stuff from way too many ways... i think i can exploit that.

---

29/apr/2021 - I think my sleep schedule is getting ucked cos i don't sleep at night to keep playing dmc, wich is kinda acceptable since i don't have a formal work or anything like that lol.

---

30/apr/2021 - Yea, so that guys i wrote about who was dating my mom showed to be a jerk and they broke up. it's been more than a month since they were together and i was still watching for any slip, i won't let my mom date no dipshit cunt bastard.

---

10/may/2021 - I noticed my youtube recommendations are way too monotone, it only shows me dmc content and metal gear rising soundtracks. while searching for memes, though, i found this channel named brian david guilbert and it's pretty funny, would recommend a try.

---

14/may/2021 - I think today is the coolest day of the year, not because it was fun but because it's really cold, almost 0ÂºC, and if you're from the south or from a normally cold place, shut, i don't want to know that you use t-shirt at -5C.
